# Modelling-the-differences-in-neuronal-activity-caused-by-thermal-vs-millimeter-wave-mediated-heating
We present simulation code modeling neuronal responses to MMW radiation vs. thermal heating. Using a leech interneuron model, we show how active and passive membrane mechanisms influence outcomes. The code enables reproducible studies of non-thermal MMW effects on neurons.
